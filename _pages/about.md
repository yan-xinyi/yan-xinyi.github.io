I am currently a PHD student in Management Science and Engineering with a strong interest in the field of Natural Language Processing. I worked towards my bachelor's degree in Information management and information system at Hohai University from 2017 to 2021. 

Research Domain
======
Currently, my research focus on natural language processing and information retrieval, specifically delving into the realm ofÂ key Information extraction based on multimodal information. 
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Text processing
- Information retrieval
- Keyphrase Exrtraction
- Cognitive based NLP

Research Experience
======
2024.03 - [**Utilizing cognitive signals generated during human reading to enhance keyphrase extraction from microblogs**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457323003515), has been accepted for publication in the journal Information Processing & Management.

Additionally, I am in the process of submitting an article that explores the enhancement of keyphrase extraction performance through the utilization of section structure information.
